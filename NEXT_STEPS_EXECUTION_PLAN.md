  - 100 concurrent WebSocket connections
  - 1000 SMS messages/day
  - 1000 events/day throughput
- [ ] Integration testing with all dependent services
- [ ] A/B testing setup for metrics comparison

#### Day 11-12: Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for:
  - WebSocket connection metrics
  - SMS delivery statistics
  - Health endpoint response times
  - Error rates and patterns
- [ ] Set up alerts for anomalies

#### Day 13-14: Documentation & Training
- [ ] Complete migration guide for developers
- [ ] Create troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Schedule and conduct developer training sessions
- [ ] Record video walkthroughs

### Week 3: Production Rollout
**Focus**: Gradual production deployment with careful monitoring

#### Day 15-16: Canary Deployment (10% traffic)
- [ ] Deploy to single production server
- [ ] Route 10% of traffic to new implementation
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours:
  - Error rates
  - Performance metrics
  - User feedback
- [ ] Quick fixes for any issues

#### Day 17-18: Expand Rollout (50% traffic)
- [ ] Increase traffic to new implementation
- [ ] Continue monitoring all metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback from office staff and drivers
- [ ] Performance comparison analysis

#### Day 19-21: Full Rollout (100% traffic)
- [ ] Complete migration to new implementation
- [ ] Keep old endpoints available but unused
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring
- [ ] Prepare rollback if needed

### Week 4: Cleanup & Optimization
**Focus**: Remove old code and optimize based on learnings

#### Day 22-23: Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove deprecated WebSocket service
- [ ] Remove message queue implementation
- [ ] Remove old health check endpoints
- [ ] Update all import statements

#### Day 24-25: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Analyze production metrics
- [ ] Fine-tune Redis configuration
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket heartbeat intervals
- [ ] Adjust SMS retry logic if needed

#### Day 26-28: Final Documentation
- [ ] Update all API documentation
- [ ] Archive old implementation docs
- [ ] Create post-mortem report
- [ ] Share learnings with team

## üö® Risk Mitigation Plan

### Feature Flags Configuration
```yaml
simplified_features:
  websocket_simple: 
    enabled: false  # Start disabled
    rollout_percentage: 0
    whitelist_customers: []  # Test with specific customers first
  
  sms_direct:
    enabled: false
    fallback_to_queue: true  # Keep old system as fallback
    
  health_simple:
    enabled: true  # Low risk, can enable immediately
```

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Immediate Rollback** (< 5 minutes)
   - Toggle feature flags to disable new implementation
   - All traffic routes back to old system
   - No code deployment needed

2. **Code Rollback** (< 30 minutes)
   - Revert PR #2 merge
   - Deploy previous version
   - Restore from backup if data issues
