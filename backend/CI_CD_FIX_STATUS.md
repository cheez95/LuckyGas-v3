# CI/CD Pipeline Fix Status

## Current Status: Significant Progress Made

### Summary
- **Initial Errors**: 1,699
- **Current Errors**: 206
- **Reduction**: 87.9%
- **CI/CD Status**: Will still fail, but much improved

### Remaining Issues (206)
1. **E402** (77 errors) - Module imports not at top
   - Mostly in script files that need path setup
   - Legitimate use case in many instances
   
2. **F821** (56 errors) - Undefined names
   - Mainly missing type imports (Dict, List, Any, etc.)
   - Concentrated in test utilities
   
3. **F841** (43 errors) - Unused variables
   - May be intentional for testing
   - Need case-by-case review
   
4. **F811** (4 errors) - Redefinition of unused
   - Duplicate class definitions in migration.py
   
5. **F401** (1 error) - Unused import
   - Single instance in banking.py

### Next Steps
1. Address F821 errors in test utilities by adding type imports
2. Review F841 unused variables case-by-case
3. Fix F811 redefinitions in migration.py
4. Consider adding flake8 ignore comments for legitimate E402 in scripts

### Files Most Affected
- `tests/utils/factories/` - Missing type imports
- `app/scripts/` - Path setup before imports
- `tests/migration/` - Path setup and unused variables
- `app/api/v1/admin/migration.py` - Duplicate definitions

### Recommendation

- PR 2: Address unused variables
- PR 3: Fix migration.py redefinitions
- PR 4: Add ignore comments for legitimate E402
