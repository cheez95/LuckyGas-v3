# SMS: 5 failures, 3-minute recovery
```

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/health/`: Basic health check
- `GET /api/v1/health/detailed`: Detailed service status (requires auth)
- `GET /api/v1/health/circuit-breakers`: Circuit breaker states
- `POST /api/v1/health/circuit-breakers/{service}/reset`: Manual reset
