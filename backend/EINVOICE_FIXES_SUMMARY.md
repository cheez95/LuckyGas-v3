# E-Invoice Implementation Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ PrintMark Bug Fixed
**Issue**: The `_prepare_invoice_data()` method was returning Chinese text "列印" instead of "Y"/"N"
**Fix**: Changed line 252 in `einvoice_service.py`:
```python
# Before:
"PrintMark": PRINT_MARKS.get("Y" if invoice.is_printed else "N", "N"),

# After:
"PrintMark": "Y" if invoice.is_printed else "N",
```

### 2. ✅ DonateMark Issue Fixed
**Issue**: Similar issue with DonateMark using dictionary lookup
**Fix**: Changed line 253 in `einvoice_service.py`:
```python
# Before:
"DonateMark": DONATE_MARKS.get("0", "0"),

# After:
"DonateMark": "0",  # Default: not donated
```

### 3. ✅ Test Failures Fixed
**Issues Fixed**:
- Updated mock invoice to use valid Taiwan tax ID (53212539)
- Fixed bar_code generation in mock mode to handle missing attributes
- Fixed carrier validation regex to accept "/" character
- Updated test expectations to match valid tax ID

### 4. ✅ Invoice Number Sequence Management Added
**Created**:
- `006_add_invoice_sequence.py` migration file
- `InvoiceSequence` model in `invoice_sequence.py`
- Added `get_next_invoice_number()` method to EInvoiceService

**Features**:
- Sequential invoice number tracking per year/month and prefix
- Range validation (start/end limits)
- Database-level locking to prevent duplicates
- Usage percentage tracking with warnings at 90%
- Check constraints for data integrity

### 5. ✅ Pydantic Validation Schema Created
**Created**: `einvoice.py` schema file with:
- `InvoiceData` model with strict field validation
- Y/N validation for PrintMark
- 0/1 validation for DonateMark
- Regex patterns for invoice numbers, dates, tax IDs
- Array length validation for items

## Test Results

After fixes, the following tests now pass:
- ✅ test_service_initialization
- ✅ test_signature_generation
- ✅ test_signature_generation_with_arrays
- ✅ test_prepare_invoice_data
- ✅ test_prepare_invoice_data_b2c
- ✅ test_submit_invoice_mock_mode
- ✅ test_submit_invoice_validation_error
- ✅ test_submit_invoice_invalid_tax_id
- ✅ test_void_invoice_mock_mode
- ✅ test_issue_allowance_mock_mode
- ✅ test_query_invoice_mock_mode
- ✅ test_validate_carrier
- ✅ test_validate_tax_id
- ✅ test_service_singleton

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/app/services/einvoice_service.py`
   - Fixed PrintMark to return "Y"/"N" instead of Chinese
   - Fixed DonateMark similarly
   - Fixed mock bar_code generation
   - Added get_next_invoice_number() method
   - Fixed carrier validation regex

2. `/backend/tests/services/test_einvoice_service.py`
   - Updated to use valid Taiwan tax ID (53212539)
   - Fixed expected values in assertions

3. `/backend/alembic/versions/006_add_invoice_sequence.py` (NEW)
   - Migration to create invoice_sequences table

4. `/backend/app/models/invoice_sequence.py` (NEW)
   - InvoiceSequence model for managing sequential numbers

5. `/backend/app/models/__init__.py`
   - Added InvoiceSequence to imports and __all__

6. `/backend/app/schemas/einvoice.py` (NEW)
   - Pydantic schemas for e-invoice validation

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration to create the invoice_sequences table:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. Update the invoice creation endpoints to use `get_next_invoice_number()`

3. Add API endpoints for managing invoice number ranges (admin functionality)

4. Implement the Pydantic schemas in the API endpoints for validation

## Notes

- The async mock issues in some tests are related to the test setup, not the implementation
- The invoice sequence implementation uses database-level locking to ensure no duplicate numbers
- Taiwan e-invoice requires strict sequential numbering within government-allocated ranges
