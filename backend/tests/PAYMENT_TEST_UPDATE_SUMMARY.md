# Payment/Invoice Test Update Summary

## Overview

Updated test files to conditionally skip payment, invoice, banking, and financial report tests when these features are disabled via feature flags.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Test Configuration File
- **File**: `tests/conftest_payment.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides pytest markers and fixtures for conditionally running payment-related tests
- **Features**:
  - Custom markers: `@requires_payment`, `@requires_invoice`, `@requires_banking`, `@requires_financial`
  - Automatic test skipping based on feature flags
  - Helper fixture `payment_features_enabled` to check if any payment feature is enabled
  - Auto-ignores entire test files matching payment patterns when features are disabled

### 2. Updated Test Files

#### Service Tests
- `tests/services/test_payment_service.py` - Added `@requires_payment` marker
- `tests/services/test_invoice_service.py` - Added `@requires_invoice` marker
- `tests/services/test_banking_service.py` - Added `@requires_banking` marker
- `tests/services/test_financial_report_service.py` - Added `@requires_financial` marker
- `tests/services/test_einvoice_service.py` - Added `@requires_invoice` marker to all 3 test classes

#### Integration Tests
- `tests/integration/test_banking_integration.py` - Added `@requires_banking` marker
- `tests/integration/test_financial_integration.py` - Added `@requires_financial` marker
- `tests/integration/test_einvoice_integration.py` - Added `@requires_invoice` marker

#### Performance Tests
- `tests/performance/test_einvoice_performance.py` - Added `@requires_invoice` marker

#### Unit Tests
- `tests/test_credit_limit.py` - Added `@requires_payment` marker to all 8 test functions

### 3. Integrated with Main Test Configuration
- Updated `tests/conftest.py` to import payment test configuration
- This ensures all payment markers are available throughout the test suite

## How It Works

### Environment Variables Control
Tests are skipped based on these backend feature flags:
- `ENABLE_PAYMENT_SYSTEM=false` - Skips payment tests
- `ENABLE_INVOICE_SYSTEM=false` - Skips invoice tests
- `ENABLE_BANKING_SYSTEM=false` - Skips banking tests
- `ENABLE_FINANCIAL_REPORTS=false` - Skips financial report tests

### Running Tests

#### With Payment Features Disabled (Default)
```bash
pytest
# Payment/invoice tests will be skipped with message: "Payment system is disabled"
```

#### With Payment Features Enabled
```bash
ENABLE_PAYMENT_SYSTEM=true ENABLE_INVOICE_SYSTEM=true pytest
# Payment/invoice tests will run normally
```

#### Running Only Non-Payment Tests
```bash
pytest -m "not (requires_payment or requires_invoice or requires_banking or requires_financial)"
```

## Test Output Example

When payment features are disabled:
```
tests/services/test_payment_service.py::TestPaymentService::test_record_payment_cash SKIPPED (Payment system is disabled)
tests/services/test_invoice_service.py::TestInvoiceService::test_create_invoice SKIPPED (Invoice system is disabled)
```

## Next Steps

1. Ensure CI/CD pipeline sets appropriate feature flags
2. Update test documentation to mention payment test markers
3. Consider adding integration tests that verify features are properly disabled

## Files Not Updated

Some test files may contain payment-related assertions but weren't updated because they test core functionality that should work regardless of payment features:
- Order tests that have payment status fields
- Customer tests that have credit fields
- API endpoint tests that check general functionality

These tests should handle missing payment features gracefully.
