export const TestDataFactory = {
  createCustomerWithCredit: (credit: number) => {...},
  createOrderWithProducts: (products: Product[]) => {...},
  createRouteWithDeliveries: (count: number) => {...},
  generatePaymentBatch: (orders: Order[]) => {...}
};
```

### 2. **API Mocking Strategy**
```typescript
// Mock external services for reliable testing
export const MockServices = {
  googleMaps: new GoogleMapsMock(),
  vertexAI: new VertexAIMock(),
  eInvoice: new EInvoiceMock(),
  sms: new SMSProviderMock()
};
```

### 3. **Performance Metrics Collection**
```typescript
// Collect and assert on performance metrics
export const PerformanceTargets = {
  pageLoad: 3000, // 3 seconds
  apiResponse: 200, // 200ms
  routeOptimization: 5000, // 5 seconds
  reportGeneration: 10000 // 10 seconds
};
```

### 4. **CI/CD Integration**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
e2e-tests:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      browser: [chromium, firefox, webkit]
      shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  steps:
    - name: Run E2E Tests
      run: npm run test:ci -- --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/4
