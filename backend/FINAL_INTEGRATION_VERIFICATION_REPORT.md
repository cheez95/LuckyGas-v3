2. **Customer Mobile App** - Entire Lucky Gas APP module
3. **CSV Export** - Critical for data interchange
4. **Sales & Performance Reports** - Key business metrics

## 2. Integration Points Validation

### 2.1 Integration Status Summary

| Integration | Status | Readiness | Action Required |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **E-Invoice API** | ✅ Complete | 100% | Add production credentials |
| **Banking SFTP** | ❌ Config Only | 30% | **IMPLEMENT SFTP CLIENT** |
| **SMS Gateway** | ✅ Complete | 100% | Add production credentials |
| **Google APIs** | ✅ Complete | 100% | Add API keys |
| **WebSocket** | ✅ Complete | 100% | None |

### 2.2 Critical Gap: Banking Integration

**P0 BLOCKER**: Banking SFTP implementation is missing. While configuration exists for 6 major Taiwan banks, the actual SFTP client code is not implemented. This blocks:
- Payment file uploads
- Reconciliation downloads
- Automated payment processing

**Required Actions**:
1. Implement SFTP client with retry logic
2. Add file generation based on bank formats
3. Implement reconciliation parser
4. Add scheduling for daily batch processing

## 3. End-to-End Testing Assessment

### 3.1 Test Infrastructure Status

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: E2E tests are completely broken

```
Current State:
- Unit Tests: ✅ 51/51 passing (good coverage)
- Integration Tests: ❌ Module import errors
- E2E Tests: ❌ Syntax errors, wrong imports
- Performance Tests: ❌ Not found
- Security Tests: ⚠️ Basic tests only
```

### 3.2 Test Coverage Gaps

**Existing but Broken Tests**:
- Login and authentication flows
- Customer management workflows
- Order lifecycle testing
- Driver mobile workflows
- WebSocket real-time features
- Credit limit validations

**Missing Test Coverage**:
- Banking integration tests
- E-invoice submission tests
- Multi-language support tests
- Performance/load tests
- Disaster recovery tests

## 4. API Completeness Analysis

### 4.1 Implemented APIs (87% complete)

✅ **Core APIs Ready**:
```
/api/v1/auth/* - Authentication system
/api/v1/customers/* - Customer management
/api/v1/orders/* - Order operations
/api/v1/deliveries/* - Delivery tracking
/api/v1/routes/* - Route optimization
/api/v1/invoices/* - E-invoice management
/api/v1/payments/* - Payment processing
/api/v1/predictions/* - AI predictions
/api/v1/financial-reports/* - Reporting
```

❌ **Missing APIs**:
```
/api/v1/employees/* - Employee management
/api/v1/exports/csv/* - CSV export functionality
/api/v1/reports/sales/* - Sales analytics
/api/v1/reports/driver-performance/* - Driver metrics
/api/v1/mobile/customer/* - Customer app APIs
```

## 5. Production Readiness Assessment

### 5.1 Ready for Production

## 7. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Banking integration failure | Cannot process payments | Implement and test ASAP |
| Test suite broken | Cannot validate changes | Fix before any deployment |
| Data migration errors | Data loss/corruption | Validate with production data |
| Performance issues | System unavailable | Load test before go-live |

## 8. Post-Migration Support Requirements

### Recommended Support Structure

1. **24/7 Monitoring** during first week
2. **Dedicated Support Team** (3-4 engineers)
3. **Daily Standup** for issue tracking
4. **Rollback Plan** ready to execute
5. **Communication Channels** established

### Training Requirements

- Office staff: 2-day comprehensive training
- Drivers: 1-day mobile app training
- Managers: Reporting system training
- IT staff: System administration training

## 9. Conclusion

The Lucky Gas v3 system has made substantial progress with core business operations fully functional and modern architecture improvements. However, **two critical blockers prevent production deployment**:

1. **Banking SFTP integration** - Required for payment processing
2. **Broken test suite** - Cannot validate system reliability

**Recommendation**: DO NOT proceed with go-live until these P0 issues are resolved. With focused effort, these blockers can be addressed within 1-2 weeks, after which a phased rollout can begin.

### Estimated Timeline to Production

- **Week 1**: Fix test suite, implement banking integration
- **Week 2**: Run full testing, performance validation
- **Week 3**: Production preparation, training
- **Week 4**: Phased go-live with parallel running
- **Week 5-8**: Complete rollout and stabilization
