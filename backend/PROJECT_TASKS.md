## Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Google Cloud Setup → Monitoring Setup → Production Infrastructure
2. Frontend Integration → CI/CD Pipeline → Production Deployment
3. API Configuration → Security Setup → Deployment

### External Dependencies
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- Domain name for production
- SSL certificates
- GitHub repository access
- Production database credentials

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database Migration**: Test thoroughly in staging
2. **API Key Security**: Use Secret Manager, never commit
3. **CORS Configuration**: Test all production domains
4. **Authentication Flow**: Extensive security testing
5. **Cost Management**: Set up budgets and alerts early

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain rollback procedures for all changes
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Implement comprehensive logging before deployment
- Conduct security review before production
- Load test before full traffic migration

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 99.9% uptime SLA achieved
- [ ] API response time <200ms (p95)
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] 100% test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Automated deployment time <10 minutes

### Business Metrics
- [ ] All existing features migrated
- [ ] No data loss during migration
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] Google APIs integrated and monitored
- [ ] Cost within projected budget

## Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ Backend security hardened
- ✅ Environment properly configured
- ✅ Local development working
- ⏳ Ready for production setup

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Start with Frontend-Backend Integration (Epic 1)
2. Obtain Google Cloud credentials
3. Set up monitoring early for visibility
4. Review and adjust task priorities based on business needs
