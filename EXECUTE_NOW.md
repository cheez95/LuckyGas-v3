# ðŸ”¥ EXECUTE NOW - NO MORE EXCUSES

## THE ONLY COMMAND YOU NEED:

```bash
cd /Users/lgee258/Desktop/LuckyGas-v3 && ./EMERGENCY_DEPLOY.sh
```

## THAT'S IT. STOP READING. GO EXECUTE.

---

If you're still reading, you're procrastinating. 

## POST-EXECUTION ONLY:

After deployment completes, then:

1. **Check if it worked**:
   ```bash
   cd emergency && ./RAPID_VALIDATION.sh
   ```

2. **Load test data**:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < emergency/EMERGENCY_DATA_LOAD.sql
   ```

3. **Update and send comms**:
   - Add URLs to communications/UAT_INVITE_EMAIL_ZH.md
   - Send it

## STOP PLANNING. START DOING.

The next document you create should be "DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md" after you've actually deployed something.
