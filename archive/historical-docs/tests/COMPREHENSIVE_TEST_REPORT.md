3. **Incomplete Features**: Various features partially implemented

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing user guides and API docs
2. **Performance Optimization**: No caching or query optimization
3. **UI Enhancements**: Basic functionality present but needs polish

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Fix AI/ML Service**: Update mock service method signatures
2. **Fix Database Schema**: Add missing columns to routes table
3. **Create Test Data**: Import historical data from raw/ folder
4. **Begin Sprint 5**: Start financial/compliance implementation

### Short-term (Weeks 2-3)
1. **Add Unit Tests**: Minimum 70% coverage for critical paths
2. **Integration Tests**: Test database operations and external services
3. **Fix Identified Bugs**: Address all high-priority issues
4. **Documentation**: Create user guides in Traditional Chinese

### Medium-term (Month 1)
1. **Complete Sprint 5**: All financial and compliance features
2. **E2E Testing**: Implement Playwright tests for user journeys
3. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and optimization
4. **Security Audit**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment

## 🏁 Conclusion

The Lucky Gas V3 system shows significant progress with 66.7% completion. Core functionality for customer management, orders, and basic operations is working. However, critical gaps in financial/compliance features and broken AI/ML integration prevent the system from being production-ready.

**Overall Assessment**: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Required for Production**:
1. Complete Sprint 5 (Financial & Compliance)
2. Fix all high-priority bugs
3. Achieve minimum 70% test coverage
4. Complete security audit
5. Deploy monitoring and alerting

**Estimated Time to Production**: 6-8 weeks with focused development
