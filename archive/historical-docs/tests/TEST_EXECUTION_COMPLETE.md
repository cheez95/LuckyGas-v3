### 4. Key Findings Identified ✅

#### Critical Blockers
1. **PostgreSQL Test Database**: Role "luckygas" doesn't exist
2. **Async Test Decorators**: Missing @pytest.mark.asyncio
3. **Service Mocking**: Incomplete Google Cloud mocks
4. **Model Imports**: Mismatched names (CylinderType, DeliveryRoute)

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Current**: 35% overall
- **Google Cloud**: 0-30% (critical gap)
- **E2E Tests**: 0% (blocked)
- **Target**: 70%+ needed

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Run Today)
```bash
# Fix all infrastructure issues
./scripts/fix-test-infrastructure.sh
