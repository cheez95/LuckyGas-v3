## üîó Integration Points

### Backend Requirements
The following backend endpoints need to be implemented:
1. `PUT /orders/{id}/modify` - Modify single order with validation
2. `GET /orders/{id}/modifications` - Get modification history
3. `PUT /orders/{id}/cancel` - Cancel order with reason
4. `PUT /orders/bulk/status` - Bulk status update
5. `PUT /orders/bulk/assign-driver` - Bulk driver assignment
6. `PUT /orders/bulk/priority` - Bulk priority update
7. `PUT /orders/bulk/delivery-date` - Bulk delivery date update
8. `POST /orders/bulk/generate-invoices` - Generate PDF invoices
9. `GET /users/drivers` - Get available drivers list

### Database Schema Updates
1. **order_modifications** table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE order_modifications (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
     field VARCHAR(50),
     old_value TEXT,
     new_value TEXT,
     reason TEXT,
     modified_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     modified_at TIMESTAMP,
     requires_approval BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
   );
   ```

2. **order_templates** table (for recurring orders):
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE order_templates (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
     template_name VARCHAR(100),
     products JSONB,
     delivery_notes TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP,
