## üîß WebSocket Implementation Details

### Backend Components
1. **WebSocket Service** (`websocket_service.py`):
   - Connection management with user tracking
   - Redis pub/sub for cross-instance messaging
   - Event-based architecture
   - Role-based broadcasting

2. **WebSocket API** (`websocket.py`):
   - Three specialized endpoints:
     - `/ws` - General purpose
     - `/ws/driver` - Driver-specific optimizations
     - `/ws/office` - Office staff full access
   - Token-based authentication
   - HTTP broadcast endpoint for service integration

3. **Event Types Implemented**:
   - Connection management (connect, disconnect, heartbeat)
   - Order lifecycle events
   - Route management events
   - Driver location updates
   - Customer notifications
   - System alerts

### Frontend Components
1. **useWebSocket Hook**:
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Heartbeat maintenance
   - Message handling
   - Connection state management

2. **WebSocketContext Provider**:
   - Role-based endpoint selection
   - Subscription helpers
   - Centralized message handling
   - App-wide WebSocket state
