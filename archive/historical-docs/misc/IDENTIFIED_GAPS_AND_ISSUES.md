- Results in Internal Server Error (500) when calling prediction endpoints

### 2. Database Schema Issues
**Component**: Route Planning
**Issue**: Missing column in database
- Routes table missing 'name' column
- Causes error when creating routes via API
- Error: `column routes.name does not exist`

### 3. Missing Test Data
**Component**: Various
**Issues**:
- No seed data for comprehensive testing
- Historical data in `raw/` folder not imported
- Need proper test fixtures for all user roles

- Need tests for:
  - Models and schemas
  - Service layer logic
  - API endpoint validation
  - Authentication/authorization

### Integration Tests
- **Coverage**: 0% (No integration tests found)
- Need tests for:
  - Database operations
  - External service integration
  - WebSocket functionality
  - End-to-end workflows

### E2E Tests
- **Coverage**: 0% (No E2E tests found)
- Need tests for:
  - Complete user journeys
  - Mobile app scenarios
  - Multi-user workflows
  - Performance testing

## üîß Technical Debt

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Inconsistent use of environment variables
   - Missing production configuration
   - No secrets management

2. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages
   - Missing error logging
   - No error monitoring integration

3. **Documentation**
   - Missing API documentation
   - No deployment guide
   - Missing architecture diagrams
   - No user manuals in Traditional Chinese

4. **Performance**
   - No caching implementation
   - Missing database indexes
   - No query optimization
   - No load testing

## üìã Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Sprint 5 - Financial & Compliance)
1. Implement invoice management system
2. Add financial reporting features
3. Create compliance tracking
4. Integrate accounting features

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Fix AI/ML service method signatures
2. Update database schema for routes
3. Import historical data
4. Add basic unit tests

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks)
1. Complete missing features in existing modules
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Create user documentation

### Long-term (1-2 months)
1. Performance optimization
2. Security hardening
3. Production deployment preparation
4. User training materials

## üö® Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- Missing financial/compliance features (legal requirement)
- No test coverage (quality assurance)
- Database schema inconsistencies

**Medium Risk**:
- Incomplete AI/ML integration
- Missing offline capabilities
- No monitoring/alerting

**Low Risk**:
- Documentation gaps
- UI/UX enhancements
- Performance optimizations

## Conclusion

The system has achieved 66.7% completion with core functionality in place. However, the missing Sprint 5 (Financial & Compliance) features are critical for legal compliance and business operations. Additionally, the lack of test coverage and several implementation issues need immediate attention before production deployment.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Sprint 5 implementation immediately, followed by fixing the identified technical issues and adding comprehensive test coverage.
