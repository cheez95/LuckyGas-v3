# E2E Test Suite Report - Lucky Gas Frontend

## Executive Summary

The E2E test suite has been successfully activated and debugged. Major issues have been resolved, with the authentication tests now passing completely (12/12 tests). Customer management tests are partially working but require additional fixes for complete functionality.

## Test Environment Setup

### Mock Backend Server
- **Status**: ✅ Running on port 3001
- **Features**: JWT authentication, customer CRUD, orders, routes, predictions
- **Location**: `/frontend/e2e/mock-backend.js`

### Frontend Server
- **Status**: ✅ Running on port 5173
- **Environment**: Development mode with Vite

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Authentication Tests (12/12 Passing)
- Login form display in Traditional Chinese
- Successful login with valid credentials
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Protected route redirection
- Logout functionality
- Session persistence on page refresh
- Session expiry handling
- Mobile responsiveness
- Concurrent login attempts
- Form validation
- Network error handling
- Form clearing after login

### ⚠️ Customer Management Tests (1/8 Passing)
- ✅ Display customer list in Traditional Chinese
- ❌ Create new customer (form submission works but verification fails)
- ❌ Edit existing customer
- ❌ Delete customer
- ❌ Search customers
- ❌ Pagination
- ❌ Form validation
- ❌ Duplicate customer code handling

### ❌ Mobile Tests
- All mobile tests disabled due to Playwright configuration issues with `test.use()` in describe blocks

### ⚠️ Other Test Suites
- Localization tests: Not tested
- Offline/error handling: Not tested
- Predictions/routes: Not tested

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Authentication Service Fix
**Issue**: Form was sending FormData instead of JSON
**Fix**: Modified `auth.service.ts` to send JSON directly
```typescript
// Before
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('username', credentials.username);

// After
const response = await api.post('/auth/login', credentials);
```

### 2. Navigation URL Fixes
**Issue**: Tests expected `/office/customers` but actual route was `/customers`
**Fix**: Updated all page objects to use correct URLs
```typescript
// Updated in DashboardPage.ts
await this.page.waitForURL('**/customers'); // was '**/office/customers'
```

### 3. Form Selector Updates
**Issue**: Incorrect form field selectors
**Fix**: Updated CustomerPage selectors to match actual IDs
```typescript
// Updated selectors
get customerCodeInput() {
  return this.page.locator('input[id="customer_code"]');
}
```

### 4. API Response Format Fixes
**Issue**: Mock backend returning wrong data structures
**Fix**: Updated mock backend to match frontend expectations
- Orders: Return array directly instead of paginated response
- Routes: Added missing fields (route_number, total_orders, etc.)
- Predictions: Fixed structure to match service expectations
- Added missing `/auth/me` endpoint

### 5. Component Test Attributes
**Issue**: Missing data-testid attributes
**Fix**: Added test IDs to components
- Dashboard title: `data-testid="page-title"`
- User menu: `data-testid="user-menu-trigger"`

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Customer Creation Test
- Form submission successful (201 response)
- Customer created in backend
- Table not refreshing after creation
- Toast notifications not appearing (Ant Design message warning)

### 2. Mobile Test Configuration
- `test.use(device)` cannot be used inside describe blocks
- Requires restructuring mobile tests to top-level configuration

### 3. WebSocket Errors
- Mock backend doesn't implement WebSocket endpoints
- 404 errors on `/ws` endpoint (non-blocking)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix customer table refresh after CRUD operations
2. Implement proper toast notifications with Ant Design App component
3. Restructure mobile tests to use project-level configuration
4. Add WebSocket support to mock backend or disable in tests

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
1. Add test data fixtures for consistent testing
2. Implement better wait strategies instead of fixed timeouts
3. Add visual regression testing for UI components
4. Create separate test databases for isolation

### Code Quality
1. Add more data-testid attributes throughout the application
2. Standardize form field naming conventions
3. Improve error handling and user feedback
4. Add loading states for all async operations

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test auth.spec.ts --config=playwright-simple.config.ts

# Run with visible browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test
npx playwright test customer.spec.ts:37 --config=playwright-simple.config.ts
```

## Performance Metrics

- Auth tests: ~1.5s per test
- Customer tests: ~3-5s per test (when passing)
- Total suite time: ~2-3 minutes (estimated for all tests)

## Conclusion

The E2E test infrastructure is functional with the mock backend approach. Authentication flows are fully tested and passing. Customer management tests require minor fixes to handle data refresh and UI updates. The test suite provides good coverage of critical user flows and can be extended as new features are added.
