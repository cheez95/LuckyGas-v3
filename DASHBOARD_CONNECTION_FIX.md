# Dashboard Connection Indicator Fix

## 🔧 Issue Resolved
Fixed redundant connection status indicators in the Lucky Gas dashboard that were showing duplicate information.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **Analyzed Both Components**
- **WebSocketStatus.tsx**: 109 lines, connects directly to websocketService, real-time updates
- **OfflineIndicator.tsx**: 55 lines, props-based, shows sync status

### 2. **Decision**
Kept **WebSocketStatus** and removed **OfflineIndicator** because:
- WebSocketStatus provides real-time WebSocket connection status
- More specific to the app's real-time features
- Self-contained (doesn't need props)
- Shows multiple states (connected, connecting, reconnecting, disconnected)

### 3. **Files Modified**

#### `/src/components/MainLayout.tsx`
- Removed import: `import OfflineIndicator from './common/OfflineIndicator';`
- Removed usage: `<OfflineIndicator isOnline={isOnline} pendingSync={syncPending} syncing={syncing} />`
- Removed hook: `const { isOnline, syncPending, syncing } = useOfflineSync();`

#### `/src/components/common/WebSocketStatus.tsx`
- Updated text from "已連線" to "線上" for consistency

#### Deleted Files
- `/src/components/common/OfflineIndicator.tsx` - No longer needed

## ✅ Result
- Only ONE connection status indicator visible
- Shows "線上" when connected, "已斷線" when disconnected
- Clean, maintainable code with no duplicate information
- Better user experience with clear connection status
- All tests passing (7/7)

## 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run tests
./test_local.sh

# Results: 7 tests passed, 0 failed
```

## 📊 Status Displays
- **線上** (Online) - Green tag with WiFi icon
- **連線中** (Connecting) - Blue tag with loading spinner
- **重新連線中** (Reconnecting) - Yellow tag with retry counter
- **已斷線** (Disconnected) - Red tag with disconnect icon
