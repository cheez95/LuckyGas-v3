## 10. Success Criteria for Pilot

Before pilot launch approval:

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] E2E test pass rate >95%
- [ ] Driver mobile app 100% functional
- [ ] Localization 100% complete
- [ ] All CRUD operations working

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] API p95 response <100ms
- [ ] Frontend load <2s on 4G
- [ ] Support 1000 concurrent users
- [ ] Error rate <0.1%

### Security Requirements
- [ ] All OWASP Top 10 addressed
- [ ] Penetration test passed
- [ ] Data encryption verified
- [ ] Security headers configured

### Operational Requirements
- [ ] Automated backups running
- [ ] RTO <5 minutes achieved
- [ ] RPO <1 minute achieved

## Conclusion

LuckyGas v3 shows promise with solid authentication and core architecture, but critical gaps in testing, security, and operational readiness make it unsuitable for production deployment. The complete failure of the driver mobile interface alone is a showstopper that must be resolved before any pilot consideration.

**Estimated Time to Production Ready**: 2-3 weeks with focused effort

**Recommendation**: Delay pilot launch until all critical issues are resolved and success criteria are met. The risks of deploying in current state far outweigh any benefits of early launch.
