# Credit Limit Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented credit limit checking functionality as part of Sprint 3: Order Management for the Lucky Gas V3 migration project.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Model Updates
**File**: `backend/app/models/customer.py`
- Added credit management fields to Customer model:
  - `credit_limit` (Float, default=0.0) - Credit limit amount
  - `current_balance` (Float, default=0.0) - Current outstanding balance
  - `is_credit_blocked` (Boolean, default=False) - Credit block status

#### 2. Credit Service Layer
**File**: `backend/app/services/credit_service.py`
- Created comprehensive credit management service with methods:
  - `check_credit_limit()` - Validates if customer has sufficient credit for new order
  - `update_customer_balance()` - Updates customer's current balance
  - `get_credit_summary()` - Returns comprehensive credit information
  - `block_customer_credit()` - Blocks customer from creating new orders
  - `unblock_customer_credit()` - Removes credit block

#### 3. Order Service Integration
**File**: `backend/app/services/order_service.py`
- Modified `create_order()` method to include credit checking:
  - Added credit validation before order creation
  - Added manager override capability (super_admin role)
  - Returns descriptive error messages in Traditional Chinese

#### 4. API Endpoints
**File**: `backend/app/api/v1/orders.py`
- Added new credit management endpoints:
  - `GET /orders/credit/{customer_id}` - Get customer credit summary
  - `POST /orders/credit/check` - Check if order amount is within credit limit
  - `POST /orders/credit/{customer_id}/block` - Block customer credit (manager only)
  - `POST /orders/credit/{customer_id}/unblock` - Unblock customer credit (manager only)

#### 5. Schema Updates
**File**: `backend/app/schemas/credit.py`
- Created Pydantic schemas for credit operations:
  - `CreditCheckResult` - Result of credit limit check
  - `CreditSummary` - Customer credit summary information
  - `CreditBlockRequest` - Request to block/unblock credit

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Credit Summary Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/orders/CreditSummary.tsx`
- Created React component to display credit information:
  - Shows credit limit, current balance, available credit
  - Displays credit utilization percentage with color coding
  - Shows warnings for overdue amounts and blocked credit
  - Auto-refreshes when customer selection changes

#### 2. Order Management Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/office/OrderManagement.tsx`
- Integrated credit summary into order creation/edit form:
  - Added `CreditSummary` component below customer selection
  - Updates credit display when customer is selected
  - Shows credit warnings before order submission

#### 3. Localization
**File**: `frontend/src/locales/zh-TW.json`
- Added Traditional Chinese translations for all credit-related UI elements:
  - Credit limit terms and messages
  - Warning and error messages
  - Status indicators

### Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests
**File**: `backend/tests/test_credit_limit.py`
- Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Credit limit validation logic
  - Manager override functionality
  - Credit blocking/unblocking
  - API endpoint integration
  - Error handling scenarios

#### 2. Test Utilities
- `backend/tests/utils/customer.py` - Customer creation helpers
- `backend/tests/utils/order.py` - Order creation helpers
- `backend/tests/utils/auth.py` - Authentication helpers

#### 3. Manual Testing Script
**File**: `backend/test_credit_manual.py`
- Script for manual API testing of credit functionality
- Tests full workflow including login, credit check, order creation

## Key Features

### 1. Credit Limit Validation
- Automatically checks available credit before order creation
- Calculates outstanding balance from unpaid orders
- Prevents orders that exceed available credit

### 2. Manager Override
- Super admin users can bypass credit checks
- Allows exceptional order processing when needed

### 3. Credit Management
- Managers can block/unblock customer credit
- Real-time credit summary display
- Overdue amount tracking (30+ days)

### 4. User Experience
- Clear error messages in Traditional Chinese
- Visual indicators for credit status
- Real-time updates when selecting customers

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Only office staff and above can view credit information
   - Only managers can block/unblock credit
   - Super admins can override credit checks

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Credit information only accessible through authenticated API
   - Audit logging for credit management actions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Credit History Tracking**:
   - Log all credit limit changes
   - Track credit utilization over time

2. **Automated Credit Management**:
   - Auto-block customers with long overdue payments
   - Credit limit increase requests workflow

3. **Reporting**:
   - Credit utilization reports
   - Overdue payment analytics
   - Credit risk assessment

## Integration Notes

The credit limit checking is seamlessly integrated into the order creation workflow:
1. User selects customer in order form
2. Credit summary automatically displays
3. When submitting order, credit is validated
4. Clear error message if credit exceeded
5. Manager can override if needed

This implementation provides a robust foundation for credit management while maintaining the user-friendly interface expected in the Lucky Gas V3 system.
