## How to Test

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Backend
   cd backend
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Login with test accounts:**
   - Admin: admin@luckygas.com / admin123
   - Office: office@luckygas.com / office123
   - Driver: driver@luckygas.com / driver123

3. **Test each tab systematically:**
   - Click through each menu item

   - Verify data loads correctly
   - Check responsive design on mobile viewport

4. **Test new Phase 2 features:**
