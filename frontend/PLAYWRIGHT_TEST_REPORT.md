- **Impact**: Blocked requests, data not loading

#### 3. API Validation Errors
- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/orders/statistics`
- **Status**: 422 Unprocessable Entity
- **Error**: "è³‡æ–™é©—è­‰å¤±æ•—" (Data validation failed)

#### 4. CORS Issues

### âœ… Working Features

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login successful with admin@luckygas.com
   - Token storage working
   - Session persistence functional

2. **WebSocket Connection**
   - Successfully connects to wss://luckygas-backend-production-154687573210.asia-east1.run.app
   - Connection status: "ç·šä¸Š" (Online)

3. **Dashboard Loading**
   - Dashboard page loads after login
   - Statistics cards render (with mock data due to CORS)

## Console Errors Captured

```javascript
// Critical map error causing page crash
TypeError: J.some is not a function
    at vendor-ui-chunk-CknPCvEE.js:400:4699

// Mixed content blocking
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://vast-tributary-466619-m8.web.app/#/orders' 
was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 
'http://luckygas-backend-production-154687573210.asia-east1.run.app/api/v1/customers/'

// API validation error
Failed to fetch statistics: {
  success: false, 
  detail: "è³‡æ–™é©—è­‰å¤±æ•—", 
  errors: Array(1)
}

// CORS blocking
Access to XMLHttpRequest at '.../dashboard/summary' from origin 
'https://vast-tributary-466619-m8.web.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Page Load Time**: 429ms (DOMContentLoaded)
- **Login Response Time**: 650ms
- **WebSocket Connection**: Successful
- **Navigation Timing**: 
  - DOM Interactive: 268ms
  - Load Complete: 431ms

## Test Coverage

### Test Categories
- **Authentication**: 11 tests covering login, logout, session persistence
- **Order Management**: 14 tests for CRUD operations, search, filters
- **API Integration**: 19 tests for backend endpoints
- **Console Monitoring**: Active error detection
- **Performance Tracking**: Load time and response metrics
- **Cross-Browser**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit support
- **Mobile Testing**: iPhone and Android viewports

## Recommendations

### ðŸš¨ Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Array Handling in Order Management**
   - The `safeMap` helper is not applied to all array operations
   - vendor-ui-chunk needs array safety checks
   - Consider updating the build process to include dataHelpers

2. **Fix Mixed Content Issues**
   - Update all HTTP URLs to HTTPS in the frontend
   - Check environment variables and API configuration

3. **Fix Backend Validation**
   - Update `/orders/statistics` endpoint to accept date parameters correctly
   - Fix validation schema for statistics queries

4. **Fix CORS Configuration**
   - Add proper CORS headers to `/dashboard/summary` endpoint
   - Ensure all endpoints have consistent CORS settings

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Critical Bugs**
   - Apply safeMap to all array operations
   - Update all URLs to HTTPS
   - Fix backend validation errors

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   - Execute `npm run test:e2e:all` after fixes
   - Generate HTML report with `npm run test:e2e:report`

3. **Continuous Testing**
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Run tests on every deployment
   - Monitor test results over time

## Summary

The Playwright E2E test suite has been successfully created with comprehensive coverage including:
- Page Object Model pattern for maintainability
- Console error monitoring to catch JavaScript errors
- Network request interception for API validation
- Performance metrics collection
- Cross-browser and mobile testing support
- HTML reporting with screenshot capture

However, the Order Management page currently has critical issues that prevent it from loading correctly. The main issue is the `J.some is not a function` error which causes the error boundary to trigger. This needs to be fixed immediately along with the HTTP/HTTPS mixed content issues and backend validation errors.

The test suite is ready to validate the fixes once they are implemented.
