# Test Infrastructure Fix Execution Complete

## Execution Summary

Successfully executed `./scripts/fix-test-infrastructure.sh` with manual interventions to address PostgreSQL path issues.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. PostgreSQL Database Setup ✅
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL command line tools not in PATH
- **Solution**: Located tools at `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/`
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created user `luckygas` with password `luckygas123`
  - Created database `luckygas_test`
  - Granted all privileges to luckygas user
- **Verification**: Successfully connected to database

### 2. Test Dependencies ✅
- **Already Installed**: All test dependencies were already present
  - pytest-asyncio
  - pytest-mock
  - pytest-cov
  - httpx
  - faker
  - pytest-playwright
- **Playwright Browsers**: Already installed

### 3. Async Test Decorators ✅
- **Fixed**: 5 test files updated with @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators
  - tests/integration/google_cloud/test_e2e_scenarios.py
  - tests/e2e/test_driver_mobile_flow.py
  - tests/e2e/test_customer_management.py
  - tests/e2e/test_order_flow.py
  - tests/e2e/test_login_flow.py
- **Note**: Most test files already had proper decorators

### 4. Test Configuration ✅
- **conftest.py**: Already comprehensive and properly configured
- **Environment**: Test environment properly set up
- **Mocking**: Google Cloud services mocked in test_env_setup.py

## Test Execution Results

### Quick Verification
- **Simple Tests**: PASSED (2/2)
  - test_root
  - test_health_check
- **Infrastructure**: Working correctly with proper PYTHONPATH

### Unit Test Run
- **Total Tests**: 109 unit tests
- **Results**: 43 failed, 1 passed, 65 errors
- **Coverage**: 33% (slight decrease from 35%)

### Remaining Issues

1. **Redis Connection**
   - Many cache tests failing due to Redis connection
   - Need to ensure Redis is running or properly mocked

2. **Service Initialization**
   - Google Cloud service tests have initialization errors
   - Circuit breaker tests missing proper setup

3. **Async Fixture Warnings**
   - Some tests still show async fixture warnings
   - Need to update fixture decorators to use @pytest_asyncio.fixture

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start Redis**:
   ```bash
   brew services start redis
   # or
   redis-server
   ```

2. **Fix Async Fixtures**:
   Update conftest.py fixtures from `@pytest.fixture` to `@pytest_asyncio.fixture`

3. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="/Users/lgee258/Desktop/LuckyGas-v3/backend:$PYTHONPATH"
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh all true
   ```

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Backend unit tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh backend-unit true

# Integration tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh backend-integration true

# E2E tests with Playwright
./scripts/run-tests.sh e2e false

# All tests with coverage
./scripts/run-tests.sh all true
```

## Infrastructure Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Working | Database and user created |
| Test Database | ✅ Created | luckygas_test ready |
| Dependencies | ✅ Installed | All packages present |
| Playwright | ✅ Ready | Browsers installed |
| Async Decorators | ✅ Fixed | 5 files updated |
| Redis | ❌ Need to start | Required for cache tests |
| Coverage | ⚠️ 33% | Below target |

## Key Achievements

1. **Database Infrastructure**: Fully configured and operational
2. **Test Framework**: All dependencies and configurations in place
3. **E2E Readiness**: Playwright installed and configured
4. **Async Support**: Critical test files updated for async execution

## Conclusion

The test infrastructure fixes have been successfully applied. The main blocker (PostgreSQL database) has been resolved, and the test suite is now operational. While many tests still fail due to Redis and service initialization issues, the infrastructure is ready for comprehensive testing including Playwright E2E tests.

To achieve full test suite success:
1. Start Redis service
2. Fix remaining async fixture warnings
3. Complete service mocking for Google Cloud APIs
4. Address individual test failures

The foundation is now solid for achieving the 70%+ coverage target.
