## üéØ Executive Summary

The final security hardening sprint has successfully addressed all critical vulnerabilities in LuckyGas v3. The system is now secure for production deployment with comprehensive protections against API key exposure, webhook attacks, and other security threats.

---

## üîí Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Google Maps API Key Protection ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETE - Zero frontend exposure

**Implementation**:
- Removed all API keys from frontend code
- Created secure map loader service
- Enhanced proxy with caching and deduplication
- Added rate limiting and usage tracking

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Before (INSECURE):
const GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'AIza...'; // EXPOSED!

// After (SECURE):
const mapUrl = await mapLoaderService.getAuthenticatedUrl();
// Returns time-limited, signed URL from backend proxy
```

### 2. Webhook Signature Validation ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETE - All webhooks secured

**SMS Webhooks**:
- Twilio: HMAC-SHA256 validation
- Every8d: MD5 signature verification
- Mitake: Custom signature validation

**Payment Webhooks**:
- Stripe: Webhook signature validation
- ECPay: CheckMacValue verification
- TapPay: HMAC validation

**Security Features**:
- Timestamp validation (5-minute window)
- Replay attack prevention
- Idempotency handling
- Comprehensive audit logging

### 3. Security Infrastructure ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETE - Enterprise-grade protection

**Monitoring System**:
- Brute force detection (>10 failures/hour)
- Webhook failure tracking
- API usage anomaly detection
- Real-time security alerts

**Security Headers**:
```nginx
# Content Security Policy
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://maps.googleapis.com; ...";

# Additional protections
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000";
```

## üîë API Key Management

### Immediate Actions
1. **Revoke** any historically exposed keys
2. **Create** new keys with restrictions:
   ```
   Development: localhost only, 100 req/day
   Staging: staging domain, 1000 req/day
   Production: production domain, 50000 req/day
   ```
3. **Configure** all keys in Secret Manager
4. **Enable** key rotation (90-day cycle)

### Security Configuration
```javascript
// Google Maps (Browser Key)
{
  name: "luckygas-prod-maps",
  restrictions: {
    http_referrers: ["https://*.luckygas.com.tw"],
    apis: ["maps", "places"],
    rate_limit: "50000/day"
  }
}

// Twilio (Server Key)
{
  account_type: "production",
  subaccount: "luckygas-prod",
  geographic_permissions: ["TW"],
  daily_spend_limit: 100
}
```
