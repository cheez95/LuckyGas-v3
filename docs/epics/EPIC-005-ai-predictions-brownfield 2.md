# AI-Powered Delivery Predictions - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Implement AI-powered delivery predictions using Google Vertex AI to analyze 4+ years of historical data (349,920 records), enabling proactive customer service and reducing emergency orders by 40% through accurate demand forecasting.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Manual order creation based on customer calls
- Technology stack: FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL with 349,920 historical delivery records
- Integration points: Order service, customer database, delivery history table

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Daily batch predictions using Vertex AI ML models
- How it integrates: New prediction service that generates order suggestions for review
- Success criteria: 
  - 85% prediction accuracy for regular customers
  - 40% reduction in emergency orders
  - Daily predictions generated in <30 seconds

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Vertex AI Integration & Model Training**
   - Configure Vertex AI endpoint and credentials
   - Prepare training dataset from 349,920 historical records
   - Train and deploy consumption prediction model

2. **Story 2: Prediction Service Implementation**
   - Create batch prediction service for daily runs
   - Implement prediction storage and retrieval APIs
   - Add confidence scoring and explainability features

3. **Story 3: Prediction Review UI**
   - Build prediction dashboard showing suggested orders
   - Add approve/reject/modify functionality
   - Display prediction confidence and reasoning

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** Low prediction accuracy for irregular customers
- **Mitigation:** Use confidence thresholds, require human review for low-confidence predictions
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable predictions and revert to manual ordering

## Definition of Done
- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React
- Integration points: Order service, customer model, delivery_history table with 349,920 records
- Existing patterns to follow: Service layer architecture, batch job patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Predictions are suggestions only, manual ordering remains primary
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering AI-powered delivery predictions using Vertex AI."
