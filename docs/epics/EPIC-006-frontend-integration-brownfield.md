# Frontend-Backend Integration Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Establish secure, efficient communication between React frontend and FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, real-time WebSocket updates, and Traditional Chinese localization to enable seamless user experience for Lucky Gas staff and drivers.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Backend APIs fully implemented and tested
- Technology stack: FastAPI backend with JWT auth, React frontend with TypeScript
- Integration points: Authentication endpoints, Customer/Order/Route APIs, WebSocket service

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: API client configuration, authentication flow, real-time updates
- How it integrates: Axios client with interceptors, JWT token management, WebSocket connection
- Success criteria: 
  - <200ms API response time (p95)
  - Automatic token refresh without user disruption
  - Real-time updates within 1 second

## Stories

1. **Story 1: API Client & Authentication Setup**
   - Configure axios with request/response interceptors
   - Implement JWT token storage and refresh logic
   - Add comprehensive error handling with retry

2. **Story 2: Core Feature Integration**
   - Connect customer management UI to backend APIs
   - Integrate order creation and tracking flows
   - Enable route visualization with real data

3. **Story 3: Real-time Updates & Localization**
   - Establish WebSocket connection for live updates
   - Implement Traditional Chinese (AÔ-‡) throughout UI
   - Add connection status indicators and reconnection logic

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** CORS issues in production environment
- **Mitigation:** Configure CORS properly for all production domains, test thoroughly
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to previous frontend build if integration fails

## Definition of Done
- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React
- Integration points: JWT auth endpoints, RESTful APIs, WebSocket service
- Existing patterns to follow: React hooks, TypeScript interfaces, Material-UI components
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering seamless frontend-backend integration with real-time updates."
