# Google Cloud Platform Setup - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Configure production-ready Google Cloud services with security best practices, enabling route optimization and AI predictions while maintaining strict cost controls and security compliance for Lucky Gas operations.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Local development environment with mock services
- Technology stack: FastAPI backend ready for GCP integration
- Integration points: Route optimization service, AI prediction service, file storage

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: GCP service accounts, APIs enablement, security configuration
- How it integrates: Environment variables, service account credentials, API client libraries
- Success criteria: 
  - All GCP services accessible with proper authentication
  - Monthly costs within NT$3,000 budget
  - Zero security vulnerabilities in configuration

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Service Account & API Configuration**
   - Create production service account with minimal permissions
   - Enable Routes API, Vertex AI, and Cloud Storage
   - Configure API quotas and billing alerts

2. **Story 2: Security & Access Controls**
   - Implement workload identity for Cloud Run
   - Set up VPC Service Controls for API access
   - Configure Cloud Security Command Center

3. **Story 3: Cost Optimization & Monitoring**
   - Implement intelligent caching for Routes API
   - Set up usage monitoring dashboards
   - Configure automatic cost alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% thresholds

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** Unexpected GCP costs from API usage
- **Mitigation:** Implement strict quotas, caching, and real-time monitoring
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable APIs and revert to mock services if costs exceed budget

## Definition of Done
- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React
- Integration points: Environment configuration, service initialization, API clients
- Existing patterns to follow: Configuration management, async service patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Zero downtime during setup, graceful fallbacks
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering secure Google Cloud Platform integration."
