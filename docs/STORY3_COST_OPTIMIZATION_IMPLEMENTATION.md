- Redis instance for caching (1GB)
- BigQuery dataset for billing analysis
- Cloud Scheduler for automated tasks
- Monitoring dashboards
```

#### Budget Processor Function
```python
- Process budget alerts from Pub/Sub
- Generate daily cost reports
- Send Slack notifications
- Calculate optimization recommendations
```

#### Intelligent Cache System
```python
- Predictive TTL calculation
- Cost-benefit analysis for caching
- Cache warming based on patterns
- Performance statistics tracking
```

### 2. Cost Monitoring Dashboard API

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/costs/cost-summary` - Current month costs and budget status
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/costs/service-breakdown` - Cost by service
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/costs/api-usage` - API usage metrics
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/costs/cache-stats` - Cache performance
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/costs/recommendations` - Optimization suggestions

### 3. Cost Control Mechanisms

#### API Cost Structure
```python
API_COSTS = {
    "routes": 0.005,      # $5 per 1000 requests
    "geocoding": 0.005,   # $5 per 1000 requests
    "places": 0.017,      # $17 per 1000 requests
    "vertex_ai": 0.001,   # $1 per 1000 predictions
}
```

#### Alert Thresholds
- **50% (NT$1,500)**: Info alert, monitor closely
- **80% (NT$2,400)**: Warning, enable aggressive caching
- **100% (NT$3,000)**: Critical, implement emergency controls
- **120% (NT$3,600)**: Over budget, disable non-critical services

### 4. Optimization Strategies

#### Caching Strategy
- **Routes API**: 1-hour TTL (40% cost reduction)
- **Geocoding**: 24-hour TTL (addresses rarely change)
- **Places API**: 1-hour TTL
- **Vertex AI**: Result caching for predictions

#### Batch Processing
- Combine multiple predictions
- Schedule heavy operations off-peak
- Aggregate similar requests

## Cost Projections

### Monthly Cost Breakdown (Estimated)
```
Service               | Cost (NT$) | % of Budget
---------------------|------------|------------
Routes API           | 600        | 20%
Cloud Run            | 450        | 15%
Cloud SQL            | 400        | 13%
Vertex AI            | 300        | 10%
Cloud Storage        | 200        | 7%
Redis Cache          | 150        | 5%
Monitoring/Logging   | 100        | 3%
Other Services       | 100        | 3%
---------------------|------------|------------
Total                | 2,300      | 77%
Buffer               | 700        | 23%
```

### Savings from Optimization
- **Caching**: ~NT$800/month (35% reduction in API costs)
- **Batch Processing**: ~NT$200/month 
- **Off-peak Scheduling**: ~NT$100/month
- **Total Savings**: ~NT$1,100/month

## Monitoring Dashboard Features

### Real-time Metrics
1. **Current Month Spend** - Live tracking vs budget
2. **Daily Spend Trend** - Historical and projected
3. **Service Breakdown** - Pie chart of costs
4. **API Usage** - Request counts and trends
5. **Cache Performance** - Hit rates and savings

### Automated Reports
- **Daily Summary** - Sent at 9 AM Taiwan time
- **Weekly Analysis** - Cost trends and projections
- **Monthly Review** - Full breakdown and recommendations

### Alert Examples

#### Slack Alert Format
```
🚨 Lucky Gas Budget Alert
Budget Used: 85.2%
Current Cost: NT$2,556 ($81.14)
Monthly Budget: NT$3,000 ($95.24)
Remaining: NT$444 ($14.10)

Top Services by Cost:
• Maps APIs: NT$680
• Cloud Run: NT$512
• Cloud SQL: NT$423

Recommendations:
⚠️ Review and optimize high-cost services immediately
⚠️ Enable aggressive caching for all API calls
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Budget alerts** sent only to authorized personnel
2. **Cost dashboards** require admin/manager role
3. **Cache invalidation** restricted to admins
4. **Billing data** encrypted in BigQuery

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test budget alert processing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/internal/process-budget-alert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"costAmount": 85, "budgetAmount": 95.24}'

# Get cost summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/costs/cost-summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Check cache stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/costs/cache-stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Automated Monitoring
- Budget utilization tracked hourly
- Cache hit rates monitored
- API error rates tracked
- Cost anomalies detected

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy Terraform Infrastructure**
```bash
cd terraform/monitoring
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

2. **Deploy Budget Processor Function**

echo -n "YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL" | gcloud secrets create cost-alerts-webhook --data-file=-
```

4. **Enable Billing Export to BigQuery**
- Go to Cloud Console > Billing > Billing export
- Select BigQuery export
- Choose dataset: `billing_export`

5. **Set Up Monitoring Dashboards**
- Dashboards automatically created by Terraform
