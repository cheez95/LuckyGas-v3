# Story 3.2: Route Optimization Algorithm

**Epic**: 3 - Route Optimization System
**Story ID**: STORY-014
**Status**: Ready for Review
**Points**: 13
**Assignee**: Backend Agent (Primary), Architect Agent (Support)
**Track**: A - Core Algorithm

## Story Statement

As a logistics manager, I need routes optimized for multiple constraints so that deliveries are efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Support 100+ delivery stops
2. ✅ Consider time windows for each customer  
3. ✅ Account for vehicle capacity (cylinders)
4. ✅ Handle driver shift constraints
5. ✅ Optimize for fuel and time

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 successfully implemented GoogleRoutesService with:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting (10 req/s)
- Taiwan-specific configuration
- Mock server for testing
- 94% test coverage
[Source: docs/ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_STORY1_COMPLETE.md]

### Data Models
**Order Model** (`backend/app/models/order.py`):
- Contains delivery location (latitude, longitude)
- Time window constraints (delivery_date, delivery_time_slot)
- Cylinder quantities by type
- Customer reference
[Source: LUCKY_GAS_BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#Database Models]

**Route Model** (`backend/app/models/route.py`):
- Links to driver
- Contains route_date
- Has RouteStop relationship (order, sequence, arrival_time, departure_time)
[Source: LUCKY_GAS_BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#Database Models]

**Vehicle/Driver** (`backend/app/models/driver.py`):
- Work schedule (shift_start, shift_end)
- Vehicle capacity constraints
- Current location tracking

### API Specifications
**Optimization Endpoint** (new):
- POST `/api/v1/routes/optimize`
- Request: OptimizationRequest with orders, vehicles, constraints
- Response: OptimizationResponse with optimized routes
- Must integrate with existing route management endpoints
[Source: ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_VRP_PROMPT.md#API Contract]

### Component Specifications
No frontend components required for this story - backend algorithm only.

### File Locations

- **Update**: `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` (register endpoint)
- **Update**: `backend/requirements.txt` (add OR-Tools)
[Source: LUCKY_GAS_BROWNFIELD_ARCHITECTURE.md#Project Structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for VRP algorithm with various constraints
- Performance tests ensuring <5 second optimization for 100 stops
- Integration tests with GoogleRoutesService
- Edge case tests (impossible constraints, all urgent)
- Load tests for concurrent optimization requests
[Source: Testing strategy implied by acceptance criteria]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing GoogleRoutesService from Story 3.1
- Performance target: <5 seconds for 100 stops
- Memory efficient for concurrent requests
- Taiwan-specific traffic patterns (peak hours: 7-9 AM, 5-7 PM)
- Business hours constraint: 9 AM - 6 PM typical
- Lunch break consideration: 12 PM - 1 PM
[Source: EPIC-003-route-optimization.md#Technical Notes]

### Integration Points
- **GoogleRoutesService**: Use for distance matrix calculations
- **Intelligent Cache**: Leverage existing caching system
- **Order Service**: Fetch pending orders for optimization
- **Route Service**: Save optimized routes
- **WebSocket Service**: Send progress updates
