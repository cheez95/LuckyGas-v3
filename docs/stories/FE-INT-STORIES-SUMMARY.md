# Frontend-Backend Integration Stories Summary

## Epic Overview
The Frontend-Backend Integration epic has been broken down into 3 focused stories that build upon each other to establish seamless communication between the React frontend and FastAPI backend.

## Story Breakdown

### Story 1: API Client & Authentication Setup (STORY-FE-INT-01)
**Priority**: Must complete first
**Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Key Deliverables**:
- Axios client with JWT interceptors
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- TypeScript interfaces for all API responses

**Dependencies**: None (foundation story)

### Story 2: Core Feature Integration (STORY-FE-INT-02)  
**Priority**: Second
**Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Key Deliverables**:
- Customer management UI with CRUD operations
- Order creation with validation
- Route visualization interface
- React Query integration for caching

**Dependencies**: Requires Story 1 completion

### Story 3: Real-time Updates & Localization (STORY-FE-INT-03)
**Priority**: Third
**Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Key Deliverables**:
- WebSocket connection with auto-reconnection
- Real-time order and delivery updates
- Complete Traditional Chinese localization
- Connection status indicators

**Dependencies**: Requires Stories 1 & 2 completion

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Order
1. **Day 1**: Complete Story 1 (API Client & Auth)
   - Morning: Set up axios client and interceptors
   - Afternoon: Implement token refresh and error handling

2. **Day 2-3**: Complete Story 2 (Core Features)
   - Day 2 AM: Customer management UI
   - Day 2 PM: Order creation form
   - Day 3 AM: Route visualization
   - Day 3 PM: Integration testing

3. **Day 4**: Complete Story 3 (Real-time & i18n)
   - Morning: WebSocket implementation
   - Afternoon: Localization setup and testing

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Integration tests for API communication
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- WebSocket connection resilience testing
- Localization completeness verification

### Risk Mitigation
- Each story has independent rollback capability
- No changes to backend API contracts
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Comprehensive error handling at each layer

## Success Metrics
- API response time <200ms (p95)
- Zero authentication disruptions
- Real-time updates within 1 second
- 100% UI text localized to Traditional Chinese
- All existing backend functionality preserved

## Next Steps
1. Assign developers to each story
2. Set up development environment with backend running
3. Create feature branches for each story
4. Implement Story 1 as foundation
5. Proceed with Stories 2 & 3 in sequence

## Notes for Story Manager
These stories are designed to be implemented sequentially, with each building on the previous. The modular approach allows for incremental testing and validation. If any story reveals additional complexity, it can be split further without affecting the others.

All stories maintain backward compatibility with the existing backend, ensuring system integrity throughout the integration process.
