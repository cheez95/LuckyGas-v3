## üéØ Security Fix Priority Matrix

### Priority Calculation

The priority score is calculated using the following formula:
```
Priority Score = (CVSS Base Score √ó 10) + (Exploitability √ó 20) + (Business Impact √ó 30) + (Exposure √ó 20) + (Fix Complexity √ó -20)
```

### Priority Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Score Guidelines |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **CVSS Score** | 10% | 0-3.9 = Low (1), 4.0-6.9 = Medium (2), 7.0-8.9 = High (3), 9.0-10.0 = Critical (4) |
| **Exploitability** | 20% | Not Exploitable (0), Difficult (1), Moderate (2), Easy (3), Automated (4) |
| **Business Impact** | 30% | Minimal (1), Low (2), Medium (3), High (4), Critical (5) |
| **Exposure** | 20% | Internal Only (1), Partners (2), Authenticated Users (3), Internet (4) |
| **Fix Complexity** | -20% | Trivial (1), Simple (2), Moderate (3), Complex (4), Architectural (5) |

### Priority Levels

| Priority Score | Level | Response Time | Description |
|----------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 90-100 | P0 - Emergency | 4 hours | Drop everything, all hands on deck |
| 70-89 | P1 - Critical | 24 hours | Immediate action required |
| 50-69 | P2 - High | 7 days | Schedule for current sprint |
| 30-49 | P3 - Medium | 30 days | Schedule for next release |
| 0-29 | P4 - Low | 90 days | Backlog for future consideration |

### Sample Priority Calculation

```yaml
Vulnerability: SQL Injection in Login Form
CVSS Score: 8.5 (High) = 3 points √ó 10% = 3
Exploitability: Easy (3) √ó 20% = 12
Business Impact: Critical (5) √ó 30% = 30  
Exposure: Internet (4) √ó 20% = 16
Fix Complexity: Simple (2) √ó -20% = -8

Total Priority Score: 3 + 12 + 30 + 16 - 8 = 85 (P1 - Critical)
```

### Priority Assignment Template
