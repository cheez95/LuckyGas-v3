Detailed test cases and procedures for:
- SQL Injection Testing
- XSS Vulnerability Testing
- Authentication Bypass Attempts
- API Abuse Scenarios
- Session Management Tests
- Input Validation Tests
- Cryptographic Tests
- Business Logic Tests

**Usage**: Security teams and penetration testers should use these scenarios during security assessments.

### 3. [Security Remediation Templates](./SECURITY_REMEDIATION_TEMPLATES.md)
Standardized templates for:
- Vulnerability Report Template
- Security Fix Priority Matrix
- Penetration Test Scope Document
- Vulnerability Tracking Dashboard

**Usage**: Use these templates to document findings, prioritize fixes, and manage security remediation efforts.

### 4. [Security Architecture Overview](./SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)
Comprehensive overview of:
- Security Architecture Principles
- Security Layers (Network, Application, Data)
- Security Components and Data Flows
- Compliance Framework
- Security Maturity Model

**Usage**: Reference for architects, developers, and security teams to understand the security design.

### 5. [Incident Response Plan](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md)
Complete incident response procedures including:
- Incident Classification and Severity Levels
- Response Team Structure and Contacts
- Detection and Analysis Procedures
- Containment and Recovery Steps
- Communication Plans
- Incident Response Runbooks

**Usage**: Critical document for handling security incidents. All team members should be familiar with their roles.

### 6. [Security Best Practices Guide](./SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES_GUIDE.md)
Best practices for:
- Developers (Secure Coding, Authentication, Error Handling)
- Operations (Infrastructure Security, Monitoring, Backups)
- End Users (Account Security, Safe Browsing)
- Role-specific Security Checklists

**Usage**: Daily reference for all team members to maintain security standards.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Security Audit

### Week 2-3 Security Audit Plan

- [ ] Document findings using [Vulnerability Report Template](./SECURITY_REMEDIATION_TEMPLATES.md#vulnerability-report-template)

**Day 3-4: Application Security Testing**
- [ ] Run automated scans (SAST, DAST, dependency checks)
- [ ] Execute test scenarios from [Security Test Scenarios](./SECURITY_TEST_SCENARIOS.md)
- [ ] Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

**Day 5: Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] Test authentication mechanisms using AUTH test cases
- [ ] Verify RBAC implementation
- [ ] Check session management security

#### **Week 3: Testing & Remediation**

**Day 1-2: API Security & Data Protection**
- [ ] Execute API abuse scenarios
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Verify encryption implementation
- [ ] Check PII handling compliance

**Day 3-4: Penetration Testing**
- [ ] Use [Penetration Test Scope Document](./SECURITY_REMEDIATION_TEMPLATES.md#penetration-test-scope-document)
- [ ] Execute manual penetration tests
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

**Day 5: Reporting & Planning**
- [ ] Compile findings using templates
- [ ] Apply [Security Fix Priority Matrix](./SECURITY_REMEDIATION_TEMPLATES.md#security-fix-priority-matrix)
- [ ] Create remediation roadmap
- [ ] Schedule follow-up assessments

## üîß Key Security Tools

### Automated Testing
```bash
# SAST - Static Application Security Testing
bandit -r backend/ -f json -o security-report.json

# Dependency Checking
safety check --json
npm audit --json

# Container Scanning

# Infrastructure Scanning
gcloud compute security-policies list
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# API Security Testing
python security_test_scenarios.py --category api

# Authentication Testing
python security_test_scenarios.py --category auth

# SQL Injection Testing
sqlmap -u "https://api.luckygas.com/customers?id=1" --batch
```

## üìä Security Metrics to Track

1. **Vulnerability Metrics**
   - Number of vulnerabilities by severity
   - Mean time to detect (MTTD)
   - Mean time to remediate (MTTR)
   - Vulnerability aging

2. **Operational Metrics**
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - API rate limit violations
   - Security incidents per month
   - Patch compliance percentage

3. **Compliance Metrics**
   - Audit findings closure rate
   - Security training completion
   - Policy compliance percentage
   - Third-party security assessments
