## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is credit checking so complex?
A: Taiwan's business culture relies heavily on credit terms. The system must balance customer relationships with financial risk, requiring sophisticated override mechanisms.

### Q: How are delivery zones determined?
A: Based on postal codes mapped to service areas, considering distance, traffic patterns, and delivery density for optimal routing.

### Q: What happens to orders during system migration?
A: Active orders continue in legacy system until delivered. New orders created in new system. Historical data migrated in batches.

### Q: How are prices calculated?
A: Hierarchical system checks contract prices first, then special prices, promotions, volume discounts, finally standard prices.
