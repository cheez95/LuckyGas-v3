## 🎯 Key Implementations

### 1. Secure Map Loading
```typescript
// No more exposed keys!
const mapUrl = await mapLoaderService.getAuthenticatedUrl();
```

### 2. Webhook Protection
```typescript
// All webhooks now validate signatures
if (!validateWebhookSignature(req)) {
  return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
}
```

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Detects brute force attacks
- Tracks webhook failures
- Monitors API usage anomalies
- Sends real-time alerts
