## üö® Risks & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Test Infrastructure Broken**
   - Impact: Cannot validate any changes
   - Mitigation: Fix immediately Monday morning
   - Owner: Backend developer

2. **No Frontend Integration**
   - Impact: Cannot test user flows
   - Mitigation: Dedicated developer for 2 days
   - Owner: Frontend developer

3. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Impact: 3-week timeline at risk
   - Mitigation: Parallel work streams, focus on MVP
   - Owner: Project lead

### Medium Priority Risks
1. Untested sync reliability
2. Missing performance baselines
3. No production infrastructure

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Monday)
1. **Emergency Fix**: Database model issue (2 hours)
2. **Parallel Tracks**: 
   - Developer 1: Frontend integration
   - Developer 2: Test sync service
   - Developer 3: Google Cloud setup
3. **Daily Standups**: Track blocker resolution

### Process Improvements
1. **Testing First**: Fix test infrastructure before new features
2. **Integration Points**: Define and test early
3. **Incremental Rollout**: Start with 1% before 10%
4. **Monitoring**: Activate alerts before pilot

### Technical Decisions
1. Consider simplified pilot with manual sync
2. Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
3. Add request tracing for debugging
4. Create runbooks for common issues

## üìÖ Revised Timeline

### Week 2 Goals (Adjusted)
- **Monday**: Fix tests, start integration
- **Tuesday**: Complete frontend-backend connection
- **Wednesday**: Test sync service thoroughly
- **Thursday**: Google Cloud setup, select pilot customers
- **Friday**: Run pilot with 1-5 customers

### Week 3 Projection
- Expand to 10% pilot
- Production deployment
- Monitoring and optimization
- Documentation completion

## üèÅ Conclusion

Week 1 established critical monitoring and security infrastructure but fell short on integration and testing goals. The pilot monitoring implementation is comprehensive and well-designed, but cannot be fully validated due to test infrastructure issues.

**Key Success**: Robust monitoring and feature flag systems ready for production.

**Key Failure**: Zero customers migrated due to technical blockers.

**Week 2 Focus**: Fix critical blockers, achieve basic integration, and launch limited pilot.

The project remains achievable within the 3-week timeline if Week 2 priorities are executed efficiently. The team must focus on unblocking testing, achieving frontend-backend integration, and validating the sync service with real data.

**Overall Assessment**: Behind schedule but recoverable with focused effort on critical path items.
