# Customer Journey Test Fixes Summary

## Test Execution Date: 2025-07-24

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Backend Startup Issues
**Problem**: Backend failed to start due to missing Google Cloud credentials
**Solution**: Started backend with test configuration using `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true` and `TESTING=true` flags

### 2. CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend on port 5175 was blocked by CORS policy
**Solution**: Restarted frontend on port 5174 which is whitelisted in backend CORS configuration

### 3. CustomerPage Selector Updates
**Problem**: Tests were using non-existent data-testid selectors
**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated all selectors to use actual UI elements (text, role, title attributes)
- Fixed phone number format validation (removed dashes)
- Updated dropdown selection to use title attributes
- Fixed form field selectors to use getByRole with proper names
- Added proper wait conditions for save operations

### 4. Frontend-Backend Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend and backend have completely different customer schemas
**Frontend sends**:
```json
{
  "name": "林太太",
  "phone": "0923456789",
  "address": "台北市大安區忠孝東路四段100號5樓",
  "district": "大安區",
  "postalCode": "106",
  "customerType": "residential",
  "cylinderType": "20kg",
  "status": "active",
  "notes": "週末送貨，需事先電話聯絡"
}
```

**Backend expects**:
```json
{
  "customer_code": "C001",
  "short_name": "林太太",
  "address": "台北市大安區忠孝東路四段100號5樓",
  "phone": "0923456789",
  "area": "大安區",
  // Plus many other fields...
}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Auth tests passing
- ❌ Customer creation test failing due to schema mismatch
- 🔧 Backend running in test mode
- 🔧 Frontend running on port 5174

## Next Steps
1. Either update frontend to match backend schema
2. Or update backend to accept frontend schema
3. Or create a mapper/adapter layer between them
4. Continue with remaining test fixes once schema issue is resolved
