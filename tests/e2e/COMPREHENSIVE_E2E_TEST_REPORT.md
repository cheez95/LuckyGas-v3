cd tests/e2e
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:auth        # Authentication tests
npm run test:customer    # Customer journey tests
npm run test:driver      # Driver workflow tests
npm run test:websocket   # WebSocket tests

# Run on specific browsers
npm run test:chrome
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit

# Run mobile tests
npm run test:mobile

# Debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Generate HTML report
npm run report
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions configuration
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    cd tests/e2e
    npm ci
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    npm run test:ci
  
- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: tests/e2e/playwright-report
```

## Key Test Scenarios

### Critical Business Flows
1. **New Customer Onboarding**
   - Customer registration → First order → Delivery → Payment

2. **Daily Operations**
   - Morning route assignment → Driver deliveries → End-of-day report

3. **Emergency Handling**
   - Urgent order → Route re-optimization → Priority delivery

4. **Multi-User Coordination**
   - Office creates order → Manager approves → Driver delivers → Customer tracks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Set up test data seeding** for consistent test execution
2. **Configure visual regression baselines** for UI consistency
3. **Implement API mocking** for external services (Google Maps, SMS)
4. **Add performance budgets** to CI pipeline

### Future Enhancements
1. **Accessibility testing** with axe-core integration
2. **Load testing** with Artillery or K6
3. **Security scanning** with OWASP ZAP
4. **Cross-browser testing** on BrowserStack/Sauce Labs
5. **Synthetic monitoring** in production

## Test Maintenance

### Best Practices
- Keep page objects updated with UI changes
- Use data-testid attributes for reliable selectors
- Maintain test data fixtures separately
- Regular cleanup of test accounts
- Version control test screenshots

### Monitoring
- Track test execution time trends
- Monitor flaky test patterns
- Measure test coverage metrics
- Review failure patterns
