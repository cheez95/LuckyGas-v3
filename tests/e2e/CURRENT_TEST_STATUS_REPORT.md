#### Failed Tests (10)

**1. Customer Creation Failures (2 tests)**
❌ Create new residential customer

⏭️ Delivery route map display

**Root Cause**: Features require WebSocket and map integration

## Key Issues Identified

### Critical Issues (Blocking Tests)

1. **Customer Creation Schema Mismatch**
   - Frontend sends: `{ name, phone, address, cylinder_type }`
   - Backend expects: Complex nested structure with customer_code, type, inventory array
   - Impact: All customer creation tests fail

2. **Missing API Endpoints**
   - `/customers/statistics` returns 422 errors
   - Impact: Console errors but doesn't block functionality

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Customer edit returns 403 Forbidden
   - Impact: Edit functionality tests fail

### Missing Features

1. **Customer Management**
   - No customer detail view
   - No order history display
   - No inventory management UI

2. **Order Management**  
   - No bulk order creation
   - Single product limitation

3. **Customer Portal**
   - Missing delivery history section
   - No reorder functionality
   - Limited tracking features

4. **Authentication**
   - Forgot password flow not implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Customer Creation Schema**
   ```typescript
   // Add transformation layer in CustomerManagement.tsx
   transformToBackendSchema(formData) {
     return {
       customer_code: generateCustomerCode(),
       type: 'individual',
       name: formData.name,
       phone: formData.phone,
       address: formData.address,
       inventory: [{
         cylinder_type: formData.cylinder_type,
         quantity: 1
       }]
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Permission Issues**
   - Check role permissions for office staff
   - Ensure edit endpoints are accessible

3. **Add Missing UI Elements**
   - Customer detail view with tabs
   - Order history display
   - Delivery history in customer portal

### Medium Priority

1. **Implement Missing Features**
   - Bulk order creation
   - Inventory management
   - Reorder functionality
   - Forgot password flow

2. **Fix API Issues**
   - Customer statistics endpoint
   - Proper error handling

### Low Priority

1. **Enhancement Features**
   - Real-time tracking
   - Map visualization
   - WebSocket notifications

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Continue with driver workflow tests
2. ✅ Run WebSocket tests  
3. ✅ Generate complete test report
4. 🔄 Fix critical schema issues
5. 🔄 Re-run failed tests after fixes
