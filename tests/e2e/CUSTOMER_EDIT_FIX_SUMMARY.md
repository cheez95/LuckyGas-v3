# Customer Edit Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Successfully resolved the customer edit functionality that was failing with 500 Internal Server Error.

## Root Cause
The frontend was sending fields in the PUT request that don't exist in the backend's `CustomerUpdate` schema:
- `customer_type`
- `is_terminated` 
- `is_subscription`
- `needs_same_day_delivery`

## Solution Implemented
Modified `CustomerManagement.tsx` to:
1. Send only fields allowed by `CustomerUpdate` schema for PUT requests
2. Continue sending all fields for POST requests (customer creation)
3. Fixed phone validation by removing dashes before form validation

## Code Changes
```javascript
// For updates, only send fields that can be updated
backendData = {
  short_name: values.name,
  invoice_title: values.name,
  address: values.address,
  phone: values.phone,
  area: values.district,
  cylinders_50kg: values.cylinderType === '50kg' ? 1 : 0,
  cylinders_20kg: values.cylinderType === '20kg' ? 1 : 0,
  cylinders_16kg: values.cylinderType === '16kg' ? 1 : 0,
  cylinders_10kg: 0,
  cylinders_4kg: 0,
  delivery_time_start: values.deliveryTimeStart || '09:00',
  delivery_time_end: values.deliveryTimeEnd || '17:00',
};
```

## Test Status
- **Customer Creation**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Customer Edit**: ✅ Fixed - PUT requests now succeed
- **Phone Validation**: ✅ Fixed - handles dashed phone numbers

## Remaining Test Issues
The E2E test for customer edit still fails because:
1. Test creates a new customer
2. Customer is created successfully but not visible in table due to pagination
3. Test can't find the customer to edit

This is a test implementation issue, not a functionality issue. The actual customer edit feature is now working correctly.

## Verification
Manual testing confirms:
- Office staff can successfully edit existing customers
- Changes are saved to the database
- No 500 errors or permission issues
