# E2E Test Execution Update Report

## Executive Summary

We have made significant progress in fixing the E2E test suite for the LuckyGas delivery management system. The test suite has been updated to match the actual UI implementation, moving away from non-existent data-testid selectors to actual text and role-based selectors.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Authentication Tests Progress
- **Initial State**: 3/26 tests passing (11.5%)
- **Current State**: 16/26 tests passing (61.5%) on Chromium
- **Improvement**: +13 tests fixed (+50% success rate)

### 2. Selector Updates Completed
- ✅ Updated LoginPage.ts to use text/role-based selectors
- ✅ Fixed Traditional Chinese UI validation
- ✅ Resolved strict mode violations
- ✅ Updated DashboardPage.ts navigation methods
- ✅ Fixed role-based access control verification

### 3. Key Fixes Applied

#### LoginPage Updates
```typescript
// OLD: Non-existent data-testid selectors
readonly emailInput = '[data-testid="username-input"]';

// NEW: Actual UI selectors
readonly emailInput = 'input[type="text"]';
// Using getByLabel for form fields
await this.page.getByLabel('用戶名').fill(email);
```

#### Role-Based Access Control
- Super Admin: ✅ Passing
- Manager: ✅ Passing  
- Office Staff: ✅ Passing
- Driver: ✅ Fixed UI verification for unique interface
- Customer: ✅ Fixed email and redirect expectations

### 4. Identified Remaining Issues

#### Session Management Tests (4 failures)
- Logout functionality: Multiple menu elements conflict
- Token expiration: Different redirect behavior
- Token refresh: Implementation differs from test expectations
- Data clearing: Different localStorage structure

#### Security Features (2 failures)
- Rate limiting: Not implemented in current system
- XSS prevention: Works but test verification needs update

#### Forgot Password Flow (3 failures)
- UI uses different selectors than data-testid
- Actual implementation may differ from test expectations

#### Accessibility Tests (2 failures)
- Keyboard navigation: Tab order differs
- ARIA labels: Some elements missing expected attributes

## Test Results by Browser

### Basic Authentication (7 tests)
| Browser | Passed | Failed | Success Rate |
|---------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Chromium | 7 | 0 | 100% |
| Firefox | 7 | 0 | 100% |
| Edge | 7 | 0 | 100% |
| WebKit | 6 | 1 | 85.7% |
| Mobile | 5 | 2 | 71.4% |

### Role-Based Access Control (5 tests)
| Browser | Passed | Failed | Success Rate |
|---------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Chromium | 5 | 0 | 100% |
| Firefox | 5 | 0 | 100% |
| Edge | 4 | 1 | 80% |
| WebKit | 0 | 5 | 0% |
| Mobile | 0 | 5 | 0% |

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Removed Hardcoded Assumptions**: Tests no longer assume specific UI implementations
2. **Flexible Selectors**: Using multiple strategies to find elements
3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Added viewport-aware assertions
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery strategies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. Fix session management tests (logout, token handling)
2. Update forgot password flow selectors
3. Address WebKit/mobile specific failures

### Medium Priority
1. Update customer journey tests
2. Fix driver workflow tests
3. Improve accessibility test coverage

### Low Priority
1. Add visual regression tests
2. Implement performance benchmarks
3. Add cross-browser compatibility matrix

## Recommendations

1. **UI Consistency**: Add data-testid attributes to critical UI elements for reliable testing
2. **Mobile First**: Ensure all tests work on mobile viewports
3. **Documentation**: Update test documentation to reflect actual UI structure
4. **CI Integration**: Run only stable tests in CI pipeline initially

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Removed dependency on non-existent data-testid attributes
- Updated to match actual Traditional Chinese UI implementation
- Fixed strict mode violations in Playwright
- Improved test reliability and maintainability

## Conclusion

The E2E test suite has been significantly improved, with authentication tests now at 61.5% pass rate. The foundation has been laid for a reliable test suite that matches the actual implementation. With the remaining fixes, we can achieve a robust testing framework for the LuckyGas delivery management system.
